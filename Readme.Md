API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/	Serves the main application page
POST	/ai_chat	Processes AI chat messages
POST	/upload	Handles file uploads
DELETE	/delete/<file_id>	Deletes specified file
GET	/download/<file_id>	Downloads specified file
Configuration
Default Settings
Upload Folder: uploads/ (auto-created)

Max File Size: 16MB

Storage Limit: 10GB (configurable)

Port: 5000

Customization Options
You can modify these settings in app.py:

python
# Change storage limit
user_data['storage_total'] = 20  # 20GB limit

# Change upload size limit
app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] = 32 * 1024 * 1024  # 32MB

# Change upload folder
app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = 'my_uploads'
AI Response Customization
Edit the ai_responses dictionary in app.py to add new AI capabilities:

python
ai_responses = {
    'your keyword': 'Your custom response',
    'search files': 'I can help you search through your files. What are you looking for?',
    # Add more responses here
}
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Port Already in Use

text
Error: That port is already in use
Solution: Kill the process using port 5000 or change the port in app.py:

python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5001)  # Use different port
Upload Fails

text
Error: Upload failed
Solution: Check file size (max 16MB) and ensure uploads directory exists

Module Not Found

text
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'
Solution: Ensure Flask is installed: pip install flask

Permission Denied

text
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'uploads/'
Solution: Create uploads directory manually or check folder permissions

Debug Mode
For development, run with debug mode enabled:

python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
This provides:

Automatic reloading on code changes

Detailed error messages

Debugger PIN for browser-based debugging

Browser Compatibility
‚úÖ Chrome 90+

‚úÖ Firefox 88+

‚úÖ Safari 14+

‚úÖ Edge 90+

Security Notes
File names are sanitized using secure_filename()

Maximum file size limits prevent abuse

Basic validation on all endpoints

For production use, consider adding:

User authentication

HTTPS encryption

Rate limiting

SQL database instead of in-memory storage

Future Enhancements
Potential features for future versions:

User authentication system

Database integration (SQLite/PostgreSQL)

Real AI integration (OpenAI API, etc.)

File preview functionality

File sharing capabilities

Advanced search and filtering

Mobile app version
